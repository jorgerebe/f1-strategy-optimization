# F1 Race Strategy Optimization with Deep Reinforcement Learning

This project consists of a reinforcement learning agent that optimises race strategy decisions, improving average finish position by 3.2 places in 1000 simulated races compared to results
using real-world past strategies. In order to train the agent, a F1 race simulator has been built in Python. The agent learned by interacting in races with other drivers that used real
strategies used in past Grand Prixes.
